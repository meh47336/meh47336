Hi, I'm Max. Currently a graduate student in the Biochemistry and Structural Biology PhD program at Stony Brook University. My thesis work is under the supervision of Dr. Qun Liu at Brookhaven National Laboratories where I'm using a combination of various computational approaches as well as extperimental structural biology techniques to predict and validate novel protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and humans. I've started coding around Fall 2021. My interests are molecular dynamics as well as applications of machine learning to protein structure and analysis (such as cryo-EM particle picking and structure prediction).
Still new to this but hope being involved here helps!
