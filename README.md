Hi, I'm Max. Currently a graduate student in the Biochemistry and Structural Biology PhD program at Stony Brook University. I've started coding around Fall 2021.
My interests are molecular dynamics as well as applications of machine learning to protein structure and analysis (such as cryo-EM particle picking).
Still new to this but hope being involved here helps!
