Hi, I'm Max. Currently a PhD candidate in the Biochemistry and Structural Biology program at Stony Brook University. My thesis work is under the supervision of Dr. Qun Liu at Brookhaven National Laboratories where I'm using a combination of various computational approaches as well as extperimental structural biology techniques to predict and validate novel protein-protein interactions between humans and viruses. I've started coding around Winter 2021 though the exposure and progression has slowed recently. My interests are molecular dynamics as well as applications of machine learning to protein structure and analysis.
Still new to this but hope being involved here helps!
